Students should download a QR Reading app to use our solution.
The QR code helps them send an email with their name as the subject.

Instructors can use this spreadsheet to track attendance: <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11_kqC3xLnkT3evQBfSx_L7TmtgzeszhXTkMx8hyZRxg/edit?usp=sharing'>Attendance</a>
The spreadsheet automatically records responses between 2 - 3 on Tuesdays.
