## Welcome to Tech Firm Leadership

Instructions for using our Attendy app.

We generate a weekly code using this website. :)

What do you want the code to be?

<form action="/qr_code.php">
  Weekly code:<br>
  <input type="text"><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>


Students must download a QR Code Reading app to use our solution.
The QR code helps them send an email with their name as the subject and the secret weekly code as the message.

This spreadsheet tracks all attendance: <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11_kqC3xLnkT3evQBfSx_L7TmtgzeszhXTkMx8hyZRxg/edit?usp=sharing'>Attendance</a>
It automatically records responses between 2 - 3 on Tuesdays.
