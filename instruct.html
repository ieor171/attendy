Instructions for using our Attendy app.

We generate a weekly code using this website. :)

<form action="/action_page.php">
  Weekly code:<br>
  <input type="text"><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

What do you want the code to be?


Students should download a QR Reading app to use our solution.
The QR code helps them send an email with their name as the subject.

This spreadsheet tracks all attendance: <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11_kqC3xLnkT3evQBfSx_L7TmtgzeszhXTkMx8hyZRxg/edit?usp=sharing'>Attendance</a>
The spreadsheet automatically records responses between 2 - 3 on Tuesdays.
